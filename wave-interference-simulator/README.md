# Wave Interference Simulator 🌊

An interactive educational tool for exploring wave phenomena, from classical interference patterns to quantum mechanical wave-particle duality.

## What You'll Learn

- **Wave Fundamentals**: Amplitude, frequency, wavelength, phase
- **Superposition Principle**: How waves add together
- **Interference Patterns**: Constructive and destructive interference
- **Standing Waves**: Resonance and harmonics
- **Beat Frequencies**: When waves nearly match
- **Quantum Concepts**: Wave packets, uncertainty, probability waves
- **2D Interference**: Double-slit experiment, diffraction patterns

## Features

- **Interactive Controls**: Real-time adjustment of wave parameters
- **Multiple Modes**: 1D waves, 2D ripples, quantum wave packets
- **Visual Learning**: See abstract concepts become concrete
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, build to quantum mechanics
- **Educational Examples**: Pre-configured demonstrations

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy

# Run the basic simulator
python wave_sim_1d.py

# Run the quantum wave packet demo
python wave_quantum.py

# Run the 2D interference (double-slit)
python wave_sim_2d.py
```

## Examples

### Two-Source Interference
Watch how circular waves from two point sources create interference patterns - the foundation of the double-slit experiment.

### Beat Frequencies
See how two nearly-identical frequencies create a "wah-wah" beating pattern - used in music tuning and radio receivers.

### Standing Waves
Discover how reflected waves create stable patterns - the basis of musical instruments and resonance.

### Wave Packets
Explore how localized particles emerge from wave superposition - the heart of quantum mechanics.

## Connection to Physics

This simulator demonstrates concepts fundamental to:
- **Acoustics**: Sound waves, musical instruments
- **Optics**: Light interference, diffraction gratings
- **Quantum Mechanics**: Wave-particle duality, Heisenberg uncertainty
- **Signal Processing**: Fourier analysis, wave decomposition
- **Cosmology**: Gravitational waves, cosmic interference patterns

## Educational Philosophy

Rather than just showing equations, this tool lets you **play** with waves. Adjust parameters, observe results, develop intuition. Understanding comes from experimentation.
