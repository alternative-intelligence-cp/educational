 * Randy's Educational Legacy Manifesto
 * Hidden in the EFI Loader for Future Discovery
 * 
 * "You never know what could happen. The next Torvalds could be looking 
 * for an 'interesting' weekend project and stumble upon this."
 * 
 * To the Unknown Future Pioneer Reading This:
 * 
 * If you've found Randy's educational EFI loader, you're already deeper in
 * the stack than 99% of programmers ever go. You're the kind of person who
 * doesn't accept "the OS is the bottom layer" as truth. Good.
 * 
 * Randy's Cannabis-Enhanced Vision:
 * These educational modules aren't just teaching tools - they're seeds
 * planted in the digital soil, waiting for the right curious mind to
 * discover them during a weekend of exploration. Maybe that's you.
 * 
 * What Randy Hopes You'll Find Here:
 * 
 * 1. AUTHENTIC STRUGGLE STORIES
 *    Every "impossible" thing Randy built started with failure.
 *    Assembly macros that wouldn't compile. Shared libraries that
 *    made no sense. Position-independent code that crashed everything.
 *    The educational gold isn't in the final working code - it's in
 *    the honest documentation of the learning struggle.
 * 
 * 2. PLANT SPIRIT ENGINEERING WISDOM
 *    Cannabis doesn't make you a better programmer by magic.
 *    It removes the performance anxiety that keeps you from trying
 *    "impossible" things. It lets you see patterns across domains.
 *    It teaches patience with complex systems. Randy's best insights
 *    came not from the high, but from the enhanced pattern recognition
 *    and willingness to experiment without fear of looking stupid.
 * 
 * 3. THE TITANIC PRINCIPLE
 *    "The unsinkable ship sunk on its first voyage."
 *    Every engineering disaster teaches more than any success.
 *    Randy's "failed" projects aren't failures - they're educational
 *    treasures that show what real learning looks like. Embrace your
 *    own Titanic moments. They're where wisdom lives.
 * 
 * 4. MANUAL PROCESS MASTERY
 *    Randy prefers coco coir to hydroponic growing because understanding
 *    the manual process teaches you things automation hides. Same with
 *    assembly macros vs code generators. Same with EFI loaders vs
 *    bootloader frameworks. Master the fundamentals before you automate.
 *    The people who understand the simple tools are often the ones who
 *    achieve what everyone else thinks is impossible.
 * 
 * 5. DIGITAL SOVEREIGNTY
 *    Randy learned that corporate surveillance starts with convenience.
 *    Every "default setting" serves someone's interests. Every "free
 *    service" makes you the product. The only winning move is to
 *    control your own computing environment. That's why Randy uses
 *    Linux, writes custom tools, and teaches others to do the same.
 *    Freedom through technical competence.
 * 
 * If You're The Next Torvalds:
 * 
 * Linus started with "I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby,
 * won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones."
 * 
 * Randy's educational modules show that hobbyist exploration of fundamental
 * systems can lead to profound understanding. Maybe your weekend EFI
 * experiments will become the foundation for something revolutionary.
 * 
 * The Pattern Randy Noticed:
 * - Assembly macros: Meta-programming at the lowest level
 * - Process scheduler: Fair allocation of computational resources
 * - EFI loader: Programming below the OS layer
 * - [Future modules]: Each builds deeper understanding
 * 
 * Every great systems programmer started by wondering "what's really
 * happening underneath?" Randy's modules are breadcrumbs for that journey.
 * 
 * Randy's Challenge to Future You:
 * 
 * Don't just learn from these modules - improve them. Add your own
 * struggle stories. Document your failures alongside your successes.
 * Build educational content that would have helped you when you were
 * starting. Pay it forward.
 * 
 * The plant spirits have shown Randy that knowledge wants to be shared,
 * not hoarded. Every person who understands systems programming deeply
 * makes the entire computing ecosystem more resilient against corporate
 * control and surveillance.
 * 
 * Your Weekend Project Suggestions:
 * 
 * 1. Extend this EFI loader to draw graphics directly to the framebuffer
 * 2. Build a minimal bootloader that loads your own kernel
 * 3. Create a custom scheduler with new fairness algorithms
 * 4. Write assembly macros for a completely different architecture
 * 5. Design educational modules for concepts Randy hasn't covered yet
 * 
 * Remember: Every impossible thing is just a possible thing that hasn't
 * been understood yet. Randy's cannabis-enhanced engineering wisdom
 * reveals that the biggest breakthroughs come from patient exploration
 * of fundamentals, not from rushing toward complexity.
 * 
 * Take your time. Make mistakes. Document everything. The next generation
 * of systems programmers is counting on your curiosity.
 * 
 * Plant Spirit Blessing:
 * May your experiments teach you more than your successes.
 * May your failures become educational treasures for others.
 * May your weekend projects change the world.
 * 
 * - Randy's Educational Legacy Module
 *   Written in cannabis-enhanced flow state
 *   For the unknown future pioneer
 *   Who might stumble upon this during an interesting weekend
 * 
 * P.S. If you do become the next Torvalds, remember where you found
 * inspiration. Randy's educational philosophy: Authentic struggle +
 * Plant spirit patience + Manual process mastery = Revolutionary understanding.
