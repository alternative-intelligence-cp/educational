# Cognitive Firewall

**An AI Security Game for Learning Through Competition**

## What Is This?

Cognitive Firewall is a team-based game that teaches AI security concepts through competitive play. Players learn how adversarial attacks work (and how to defend against them) by experiencing them firsthand.

Think Team Fortress meets AI safety education.

## Why?

People who would never read a security whitepaper will spend hours perfecting their game strategy. By the time they're good at the game, they've internalized:
- Pattern recognition for adversarial prompts
- Social engineering tactics
- Boundary enforcement
- Trust calibration
- Defense-in-depth strategies

**It's stealth education through competition.**

## Current Status

🚧 **Early Concept Phase** - We're exploring ideas and prototyping mechanics.

### What Works Now
- Simple Python prototype with wave-based gameplay
- Basic attack patterns (jailbreaks, gaslighting, authority spoofing)
- Scoring system and health mechanics

### What's Planned
- Team-based asymmetric gameplay (attackers vs defenders)
- Class system with unique abilities
- Multiple game modes (PvP, co-op, async)
- Full implementation in Aria language (when ready)
- Web-based multiplayer version

## Quick Start

Play the current prototype:
```bash
python game.py
```

Read the full design vision:
```bash
cat DESIGN.md
```

## Educational Value

This game teaches:
- **Adversarial thinking** - How attacks are constructed
- **Pattern recognition** - Spotting manipulation techniques
- **Defense strategies** - Building layered security
- **Social engineering** - Understanding trust exploitation
- **AI safety concepts** - Through hands-on experience

Perfect for:
- CS students learning security
- Anyone working with AI systems
- Security awareness training
- Just having fun while learning

## Contributing

This is a living project! Ideas, attack patterns, game mechanics, and code all welcome.

See `DESIGN.md` for current thinking and open questions.

## Philosophy

**Boring is armor. Fun is delivery.**

We believe the best way to teach critical security concepts is to make learning irresistible through competition and gameplay. By the time players are "good at the game," they're actually good at AI security.
