- ✅ Complete documentation and examples
- ✅ Progressive learning path
- ✅ 7,000+ lines of educational code

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd sjs-framework/examples/01-hello-world
# Open index.html in browser
```

**Documentation:**
- 📖 [Main README](./sjs-framework/README.md)
- 🚀 [Quick Start Guide](./sjs-framework/docs/QUICKSTART.md)

### 🛡️ **Defensive Compiler Design** - Type Safety From First Principles
**Location:** [`defensive-compiler-design/`](./defensive-compiler-design/)

Learn defensive programming by studying **real production bugs** from a safety-critical AI compiler. Each module documents an actual bug that made it to production, the harm it could have caused, and the defensive fix that prevents the entire category.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Why silent defaults are dangerous (type defaulting → stack corruption)
- Pointer vs value semantics (pointer confusion → safety bypass)
- Determinism requirements (locale dependencies → audit trail corruption)
- Resource limiting (missing guards → denial of service)
- Memory optimization (unbounded allocation → OOM crashes)
- Pattern recognition across all defensive programming
- How to think like a security-conscious compiler engineer

**Features:**
- ✅ 5 real bugs from ARIA-026 safety audit
- ✅ Physical/emotional harm scenarios (life-critical AGI for children)
- ✅ Hands-on labs with vulnerable/safe code
- ✅ Construction wisdom applied to compiler design
- ✅ The $8 Level philosophy: Simple tools, verifiable results
- ✅ Complete manifesto on defensive programming
- ✅ Contributing guide for your own bug stories

**Philosophy:**
> "Every bug you ship is a ladder you'll climb later."  
> "Silent defaults are lies."  
> "Boring is armor. Precision compounds."

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd defensive-compiler-design/01-type-defaulting/lab
make all
make test
# Watch the difference between vulnerable and safe!
```

**Documentation:**
- 🛡️ [Main README](./defensive-compiler-design/README.md) - Complete curriculum overview
- 📜 [Manifesto](./defensive-compiler-design/MANIFESTO.md) - The defensive programming philosophy
- 🤝 [Contributing](./defensive-compiler-design/CONTRIBUTING.md) - Submit your own bug stories
- 📚 Module 01: [Type Defaulting](./defensive-compiler-design/01-type-defaulting/) - Stack corruption from silent defaults
- 📚 Module 02: [Pointer Loading](./defensive-compiler-design/02-pointer-loading/) - Safety bypass from pointer confusion
- 📚 Module 03: [Non-Determinism](./defensive-compiler-design/03-non-determinism/) - Audit trail corruption
- 📚 Module 04: [Recursion Limits](./defensive-compiler-design/04-recursion-limits/) - DoS from resource exhaustion
- 📚 Module 05: [String Pooling](./defensive-compiler-design/05-string-pooling/) - OOM from unbounded allocation

**Who This Is For:**
- Compiler/interpreter builders
- VM engineers
- Anyone building safety-critical systems
- Security-conscious developers
- Students of defensive programming

**Stakes:** Life-critical AGI for vulnerable children - one child harmed = game over.
